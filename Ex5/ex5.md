It is appropriate use the timeit function when the reduntant steps are needed to be removed. The purpose of this function is to accurately measure the execution time of the code. The repeat function is used and is repeated multiple times, and returns the total execution time in an array format. Timeit.timeit essentially is implemented to create a more efficient runtime for execution. It optimizes the code and returns the best possible time, while disregarding redundant code. For timeit.timeit(), the best statistics is min, which is the minimum execution time. This is because the timeit.timeit() runs the code a fixed number of times and it returns the total execution time. We are looking at finding one time, so this is why average time isn't required. For timeit.repeat(), the best statistic is minimum execution time. This is because it returns an array of execution times, all representing a specific test run. The minimum refers to the best-case situation, as the redudancy is removed. It removes outliers from the code, and represents the true performance.
